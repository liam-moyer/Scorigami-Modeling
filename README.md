Simulation System

This README document provides an overview of the simulation system, detailing the functionality and structure of the two main files: "TimeBasedSim" and "ScoringEventData".

TimeBasedSim - This file houses the core code responsible for executing the simulation. The simulation within this file operates on a time-based system, 
where events unfold according to predefined time intervals or steps.

ScoringEventData - This file contains code specifically tailored for generating information on scoring events per season. Unlike the real-time simulation in "TimeBasedSim", 
the focus here is on analyzing historical data and extracting insights regarding scoring events across different seasons.


RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS:

TimeBasedSim: To run the real-time simulation, execute the code within this file and follow any prompts or instructions provided. Adjust parameters and configurations 
as needed to customize the simulation experience.
Note: The play-by-play data needed for this sim can be found from this library - https://pypi.org/project/nfl-data-py/


ScoringEventData: Run the code within this file to analyze scoring events per season. Ensure that the necessary data files or databases are accessible for analysis. 
Modify code parameters or input sources as required to analyze data from specific seasons or sports leagues.


The simulation system may require certain dependencies or libraries to be installed, depending on the programming language and framework used. Refer to the documentation or comments within the code for information on required dependencies and installation instructions.
